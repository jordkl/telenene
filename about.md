## The Hawaiian Goose (Nēnē)

The Nēnē (Branta sandvicensis) is Hawaii's state bird and the world's rarest goose. Once found throughout the Hawaiian Islands, the species was brought to the brink of extinction in the 1940s when only about 30 birds remained in the wild. Through intensive conservation efforts, including captive breeding and predator control, the population has increased to approximately 2,000 birds.



## Movement Patterns

Nēnē traditionally exhibited altitudinal migration patterns on Hawaii Island, moving between:
- Low-elevation breeding grounds (September-April)
- High-elevation non-breeding areas (May-August)
- KL Birds kinda do something different

## Nēnē Behavioral Seasons
Nēnē exhibit distinct behavioral patterns throughout the year, categorized into the following seasons:

Nesting Season: October to March. 
Molting Season: April to May. 
Flocking Season: June to September.

We can adjust these as needed. A future update will actually try to classify the seasons based on movements. e.g. no movements = molt


## Understanding HDOP
Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) is a metric used in GPS technology to assess the accuracy of horizontal position measurements. It reflects how the geometric arrangement of satellites affects the precision of latitude and longitude readings. A lower HDOP value indicates a more favorable satellite configuration, leading to higher positional accuracy. Conversely, a higher HDOP suggests a less optimal arrangement, resulting in reduced accuracy. For instance, an HDOP value below 2.5 is generally considered good, while values above 5 may indicate poor accuracy.

## Using NeneMap

1. Upload your CTT tag telemetry CSV file using the panel on the left. Important not to open the CSV in excel prior to upload.
2. Use the map controls to:
   - Switch between different base maps
   - Show/hide important locations
   - View individual location details
3. Explore the data in tabular format in the Data Explorer tab

## Data Collection
To ensure user data privacy and security, NeneMap processes all data during the active session and deletes it immediately after the session ends. We do retain error logs associated with internal functions but the associated data is never saved or retained.

## Future Features
Time-step: Smoothing out movements by predicting points between transmissions in standardized time steps (e.g. 1 hour).
